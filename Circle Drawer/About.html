    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Perfect Circle Challenge</strong> — a fun and simple way to test your drawing skills and precision!</p>
    <p>I’m <strong>Abhijeet Rupune</strong>, the creator of this little project. I’m passionate about combining creativity, math, and interactive web experiences to build games and tools that are both entertaining and educational.</p>
    <p><strong>Why this project?</strong><br />
    I’ve always been fascinated by geometry and the challenge of drawing perfect shapes by hand. This website was inspired by the classic game from <a href="https://neal.fun/perfect-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neal.fun</a>, and I wanted to create my own version where users can draw circles and see how close they are to perfection.</p>
    <p><strong>What you can do here:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Draw circles with your mouse or finger on any device</li>
      <li>Get instant feedback on how accurate your circle is</li>
      <li>Challenge yourself to improve your score and master precision</li>
      <li>Have fun experimenting with colors and brush sizes (coming soon!)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Future plans:</strong><br />
    I’m working on adding more shapes, multiplayer challenges, and some cool animations to make the experience even more engaging. If you have ideas or want to get in touch, feel free to reach out!</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting and happy drawing!</p>
